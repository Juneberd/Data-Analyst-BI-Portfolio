# WHO Air Quality SQL Data Exploration

This repository contains SQL scripts used to explore and analyze air quality data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The analyses focus on various air pollutants, their concentrations, and temporal coverage across different WHO regions and countries.

## Tables

1. **concentration_mean**: Contains mean concentration values of various air pollutants (e.g., PM10, PM2.5, NO2).
2. **temporal_coverage**: Provides temporal coverage data for the concentrations of pollutants.

## SQL Queries

### 1. Select All Data from Mean Concentrations
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM WHOAIRQUALITY..concentration_mean;
```
### 2. Select Top 20 Temporal Coverage Data
```
SELECT TOP 20 * 
FROM WHOAIRQUALITY..temporal_coverage 
WHERE year IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY Population;
```
### 3. Total WHO Member and Non-Member States
```
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN who_ms = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_MemberState,
    SUM(CASE WHEN who_ms = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Total_NonMemberState
FROM WHOAIRQUALITY..concentration_mean;
```
### 4. Average Concentration by WHO Region
```
-- Uncomment the following to display average concentrations by WHO region
-- SELECT who_region, 
--        AVG(pm10_concentration) AS avg_pm10_Con, 
--        AVG(pm25_concentration) AS avg_pm25_Con, 
--        AVG(no2_concentration) AS avg_no2_Con
-- FROM WHOAIRQUALITY..concentration_mean
-- WHERE who_region IS NOT NULL
-- GROUP BY who_region
-- ORDER BY who_region;
```
### 5. Maximum Concentration Values by Region and Year
```
SELECT who_region, 
       year,
       AVG(pm10_concentration) AS pm10Con_avg, 
       AVG(pm25_concentration) AS pm25Con_avg,

WHERE who_region IS NOT NULL AND year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY who_region, year
ORDER BY who_region, year;
```
### 6. Maximum Temporal Coverage by Region and Year
```
SELECT who_region, 
       year,
       AVG(pm10_tempcov) AS pm10temp_avg, 
       AVG(pm25_tempcov) AS pm25temp_avg,

FROM WHOAIRQUALITY..temporal_coverage
WHERE who_region IS NOT NULL AND year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY who_region, year
ORDER BY who_region, year;
```
### 7. Determine Maximum Air Quality Component
```
SELECT who_region, country_name, city, year, 
       pm10_concentration, pm25_concentration, no2_concentration, 
       GREATEST(pm10_concentration, pm25_concentration, no2_concentration) AS Max_tempCov,
